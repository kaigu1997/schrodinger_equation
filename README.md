The purpose of this program is to give an exact solution of quantum mechanic problem using Discrete Variable Representation (DVR)[1] with Absorbing Boundary Condition[2-3].

This program could be used to solve exact solution under diabatic basis ONLY.

It requires C++17 or newer C++ standards when compiling and needs connection to Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL).
